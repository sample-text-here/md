<h1>about</h1>
<h2>what is this</h2>
a simple markdown site hoster. its as simple as entering
your markdown in the text box, and clicking "create"
<h2>why is this</h2>
the modern web is just too bloated. this is my effort in 
making an easy way to host fast and good looking websites.
markdown is simple and powerful enough to host a lot of
existing websites.
<h2>how is this</h2>
thanks for asking :)<br />
this has no dependecies, nothing to <code>npm install</code>.
the core server is only ~130 LOC. as a result, it starts
almost instantly and is incredibly fast. the client-side js
is an enhancement, but not a requirement (imo that's how it
should be)
